      \begin{multicols}{2}
         Real-Time Priority
         \begin{itemize}
            \item SCHED\_FIFO, SCHED\_RR
         \end{itemize}

         CPU Affinity
         \begin{itemize}
            \item applications
            \item interrupt handlers
            \item interrupt routing
         \end{itemize}

         Memory Management
         \begin{itemize}
            \item avoid mmap() with malloc()
            \item lock memory
            \item prefault memory
         \end{itemize}

         Time and Sleeping
         \begin{itemize}
            \item use monotonic clock
            \item use absolute time
         \end{itemize}

         Avoid Signals
         \begin{itemize}
            \item such as POSIX timers
            \item such as kill()
         \end{itemize}

         Avoid Priority Inversion
         \begin{itemize}
            \item use pthread\_mutex \\ (and set attributes!)
            \item use pthread\_cond \\ (and set attributes!)
         \end{itemize}

         Be aware of NMIs

         Verify Results
         \begin{itemize}
            \item trace scheduling
            \item trace page faults
            \item monitor traces
         \end{itemize}
      \end{multicols}
   }

\cprotect\note{

   Although this is not an exhaustive checklist, it should provide
   a broad set of things to consider. And remember, the presented
   tools and methods are only as good as the application code. In
   fact, these tools and methods will require your code to
   improve because now the real-time performance can be easily
   measured, analyzed, and verified.
